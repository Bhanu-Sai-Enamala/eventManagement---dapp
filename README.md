# eventManagement---dapp
**Event DApp**
This is a decentralized application (DApp) for managing events and ticket sales built with Solidity, Next.js, and Web3.js.

**Project Description**

The Event DApp is designed to provide a decentralized platform for event organizers to create and manage events, while allowing attendees to purchase, use, refund, and transfer tickets securely on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability in ticketing processes.

**Features**

Create Events: Event organizers can create new events specifying the number of tickets available and the price per ticket.

Purchase Tickets: Users can purchase tickets for events and receive a unique ticket ID.

Manage Tickets: Users can use their tickets to attend events, request refunds for unused tickets, and transfer tickets to other users.

Event Details: View details of all deployed events, including event name, ticket price, total supply, and tickets sold.

**Technologies Used**

Solidity: For writing smart contracts that manage events and tickets on the Ethereum blockchain.

Next.js: For building the user interface of the DApp.

Web3.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.

Semantic UI React: For UI components and styling.
